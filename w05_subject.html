    <h2>Surprise Songs</h2>
    <p>
      During the Surprise Songs, Taylor plays two songs of her choice, one on guitar, one on piano.The songs can be chosen from her whole discography.
      A song cannot be replayed once it has already been played, unless it was on Midnights or if Taylor had messed up while playing it. Occasioanlly, she may also bring out surprsie guests to sing a song with her.
      Though at the start of the international part of the tour, all surprise songs were reset. Popular pairings include Death by a Thousand Cuts and Clean, and Getaway Car and Maroon.
      Taylor also uses this time to do announce things, including music videos and albums. As a result, this section is always very nervous for the fans.
