      Taylor first plays 22, with one lucky person that is picked from the crowd to receive the 22 hat at the end of the song, which is the hat Taylor wears while singing the song, and is signed by Taylor herself.
      Next, she sings We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together and I Knew You Were Trouble.
      At shows where Phoebe Bridgers was an opener, Phoebe would be brought out on stage to sings Nothing New with Taylor.
      Otherwise, Taylor would just sing All Too Well 10 Minute Version, and move onto the next set, folklore.
