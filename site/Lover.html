    <h1>Lover</h1>
    <p>
      Taylor Swift opens the whole show with Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince, singing one verse, then immediately transitions to Cruel Summer.
      Then she plays a mashup between The Man and You Need to Calm Down.
      Near the end of You Need Calm Down, she tells everyone to “let her see your hands”
      (If you ever get see a video of it, us swifties look like a cult. It is fascinating, to say the least).
      After this she gives a speech and welcomes the fans with the language that is spoken in that country.
      Next, she plays Lover and The Archer, and the show transitions to the next era, Fearless.
