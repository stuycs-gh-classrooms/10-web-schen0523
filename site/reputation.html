      Taylor comes out on stage with a black and red outfit (this is the only era where there has only been one outfit throughout the whole tour) and plays …Ready for it?.
      After that, she plays Delicate.
      The visuals during Delicate are very cool, the stage “shatters” slowly as Taylor steps on it during the song.
      Also, you can’t forget the iconic “1,2,3, let’s go b****” chant.
      Moving on, she sings Don’t Blame Me, with what I and I’m sure many other swifties would say, the best transition of the whole show into Look What You Made Me Do.
      Then we move on to the next era, Speak Now.
