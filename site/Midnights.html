    <h1>Midnights</h1>
    <p>
      Taylor starts off the final era with Lavender Haze and Anti-Hero.
      She then proceeds to sings Midnight Rain, with an outfit change in the middle of the song.
      Next, she sings Vigilante S*** (warning: i wouldn’t recommend one to watch this part with relatives), and Bejeweled (don’t forget the iconic Bejeweled dance).
      She then ends the show with Mastermind and Karma. During the East Rutherford concerts, Ice Spice was brought out on stage during Karma to sing her part with Taylor.
      Also, after the publication of Taylor’s relationship with Travis Kelce, she has made a lyric change in Karma, changing “Karma is the guy on the screen” to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs”.
      After Karma, all the dancers, band etc are brought out to take a bow, and that concludes the show.
