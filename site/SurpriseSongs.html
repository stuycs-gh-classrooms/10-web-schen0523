    <h1>Surprise Songs</h1>
    <P>
      During the Surprise Songs, Taylor plays two songs of her choice, one on guitar, one on piano.
      The songs can be chosen from her whole discography. Originally, a song couldnâ€™t be replayed once it had already been played, unless it was on Midnights or if Taylor had messed up while playing it.
      But just recently, Taylor announced the removal of this rule, in order to be more creative with the surprise songs, so she is able to play more mashups.
      Occasionally, she may also bring out surprise guests to sing a song with her, past surprise guests include Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff.
      Popular pairings include Death by a Thousand Cuts and Clean, and Getaway Car and Maroon.
      Taylor also uses this time to announce things, including music videos and albums.
      So far, two albums have been announced during this time.
