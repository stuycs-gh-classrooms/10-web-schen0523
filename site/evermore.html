      Normally, Taylor starts off the evermore era with ’tis the damn season.
      But at shows where HAIM is an opener, she sings no body, no crime with HAIM instead.
      Next, she sings willow, proceeded with marjorie.
      During marjorie, the fans hold up their phone flashlights as a tribute to Taylor’s grandmother, Marjorie Finlay Swift, whom the song is about.
      After marjorie, Taylor sit at a piano and gives another speech, then plays champagne problems.
      Immediately after champagne problems, Taylor receives a standing ovation from the fans.
      (Normally the ovation is around 3 minutes, but the longest one was nearly 8 minutes long.)
      Lastly, she plays tolerate it, and transitions to the next era, reputation.
